# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency After Silent Refresh Token

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The listener may not always trigger when the user's authentication state changes due to a silent refresh token operation. This can lead to inconsistencies in the UI, especially after extended periods of inactivity.

## Problem

Silent refresh tokens are essential for maintaining user sessions, but in some cases, the `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not respond to authentication state updates resulting from these silent refreshes. This means that your application's UI won't reflect the user's currently logged-in state.

## Solution

We suggest implementing a mechanism to explicitly check for authentication changes at regular intervals or upon specific events that might trigger a silent refresh, such as resuming the application from the background or receiving a push notification.
